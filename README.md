# Python-Tools-for-Personal-Assistants


Hello, I'm Bhoumik Pawar, and I'm passionate about being a personal assistant. I have a strong desire to help others, and I believe that being a personal assistant is the perfect opportunity to do so. I have even created scripts that can help others perform different tasks more efficiently.

I have experience working as a personal assistant for a CEO and COO. During my time in these roles, I managed officed household inventories, coordinated events and meetups, managed household expenses, and created data algorithms to find specified data. Additionally, I studied local markets and created summarized reports on local competitors and other data as per orders.

In terms of education, I have two undergraduate diplomas from HARTRON in Computer Application and Hardware and Networking, as well as an Indian High School Diploma. I also took the IELTS and received an overall band score of 7.5 with a CEFR level of C1.

I have several skills that would make me a valuable personal assistant, including familiarity with various coding languages like Python, C#, and Java, as well as computer hardware and networking techniques. I have strong organizational and coordination skills, excellent communication and interpersonal skills, and I'm a fast learner.

I've even created a GitHub repository for scripts and tools to help others perform tasks more efficiently and quickly. I'm also currently studying for the CCNA certification and have been learning about ethical hacking and cybersecurity topics for four years.

I express strong interest in an assistant position, and I'm excited about the oportunity to contribute to the growth and success of an organization with my skills and experience. I'm also confident in my ability to learn new software and programs quickly.
